# Prerequisites

Before you start working on the project, make sure you have all the required software installed on your system. The
following instructions will help you verify the installation and, if needed, guide you through the process of installing
the prerequisites.

## Node.js and npm

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. npm is the Node.js package
manager, and it's used to install libraries and tools needed for our project.

To check if you have Node.js installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see the version number of Node.js if it's installed. For our project, ensure you have Node.js version 20.x.x
or higher.

To check if you have npm installed, run:

```bash
npm --version
```

Similarly, you should see the version number of npm if it's installed. We require npm version 10.x.x or higher.

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, download and install them from
the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Angular CLI

Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool used to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.

To check if you have Angular CLI installed, run:

```bash
ng version
```

If Angular CLI is installed, you will see the version number.

If you need to install or update Angular CLI, run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Cloning the Repository

Before installing any project-specific dependencies, you must clone the project repository. Use the following command to
clone the project using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathious6/AnkiCloneApp.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd AnkiCloneApp
```

Now that you have the project files, you can proceed to install the dependencies.

## Bootstrap for Angular

For modern Angular applications, we use `@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap`.

```bash
npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
```

```bash
ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
```
