## 📝 About

AnkiCloneApp is a web application that allows users to create flashcards and study them using the spaced repetition technique.
Our goal is to help people learn more efficiently and effectively by moving the traditional Anki Desktop application to the web, making it more accessible and easier to use.

With a team of 4 developers, we built this application using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, ng-Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

Let's preview the application!
